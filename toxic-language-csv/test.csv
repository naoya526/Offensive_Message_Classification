ok,"Since my block 6 days ago, Iss246 (and his close friend, outside of Wikipedia, psyc12) immediately, frantically and systematically reverted 'masses' of established, reliably sourced edits, only hours after I was blocked. In fact, every single edit that I, through consensus, had ever established and stayed in place. These were very well sourced, solid edits. Many of these edits in numerous articles had been established and remained unchanged for over 3, even 6 months, depending on the article page. Many of these reverts during the last week, also undid the work of other editors involved in developing the 'consensus' that then stayed in place. The only editor, truly independent on these articles recently, was an editor Mark viking. He made this valid comment on the Talk:Health psychology page. He seems quite genuine, but then his comments were actually 'deleted' entirely from the public talk page? He was the only editor who commented on the rapid, systematic 'demolition job' and complete 'censorship' of my edits to these article pages containing months old, established edits, with multiple, reliable sources attached to them. Mark viking said this to psyc12 . Thanks for expanding that section, but it seems you removed a sourced assertion on the origin of OHP. Do you dispute that source, or have a source asserting that OHP and I/O psychology are totally separate? I ask this because the relation of these fields seems to be an area of contention at WP, and removal of sources isn't going to help. I invite anyone to look at the combined edit history of iss246 (and his close friend/colleague outside of wikipedia), psyc12 since the 16th of January until today in 'numerous articles.'

ok,""" Diacritics: Moving forward I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from ???? to p?te or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues. The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent: ? this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation. ? this encouragement to count """"hits"""" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word """"general"""". However, this bit seems clear that the """"modifications"""" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications. This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is """"the common name"""" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? """"[V]ersions of word"""" above should mean that """"the common """" is the same with or without the diacritical marks. Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know. Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point. Did you have some particular direction in mind? My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie S?ndoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them. A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable. And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information. On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place). This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is """"Santa Fe"""" not """"Santa F?"""" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are """"Santa Fe"""" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure """"general"""" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity. It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both. The inclusion of """"and reference works"""" strongly suggests the former. Regardless, the """"hit-counting"""" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven"

ok,""" mgts Next generation wireless networks are evolving into """"all-IP"""" architectures, and SS7 over Internet Protocol (IP) is becoming more prevalent as intelligent gateways become the de facto technology used to interconnect wireline and wireless networks. The MGTS? is the leading product for testing wireline and wireless network convergence. It is a multi-user, multi-protocol programmable test system that emulates any SS7/PSTN entity or SS7 application database, and measures the functionality and performance of signaling and media gateways. The MGTS uses powerful underlying platforms, a diverse line of network interface cards, and an extensive library of protocol test modules to significantly reduce product development time, lower production costs, and ensure conformance to telecom industry standards. MGTS reduces product development time by allowing multiple users to perform their tests concurrently. Early in the product lifecycle, the MGTS can emulate prohibitively expensive or difficult to locate network equipment. Farther along, the MGTS can support load testing to measure how much traffic the equipment can handle. MGTS also supports traffic flow monitoring between nodes in live networks. The MGTS is a flexible platform that can be customized to provide the test scripts, software protocols, and hardware needed to solve each new challenge. Testers can create complex, multi-protocol test sequences using the Protocol Adaptable State Machine (PASM?). PASM is a complete development system that constructs common test cases by defining protocol message formats, sequencing, and operations. PASM can create any type of protocol message for use in test case sequences against a device under test (DUT). With PASM, users can easily and simultaneously test circuit and packet switches over multiple interfaces. The created test cases can be executed in either simulation or load mode for functional and system integration testing. PASM helps significantly reduce the time needed to develop comprehensive 3G, VoIP and SS7 load tests. The MGTS supports a wide variety of applications: * Design and feature verification: Does the device being tested provide the desired features and functionality? * Conformance Testing: Does the device conform to industry standards? * Interoperability Testing: Will the device work with other equipment in the network? * Load and Stress Testing: How will the device perform under load and overload conditions? * Installation and Acceptance Testing: Is the device ready for installati"""

There's almost nothing else to his scientific career since 1992 but that conflict. And these conflicts are most of what makes him notable. The issues he takes up do not themselves define the """"Low-Dose Radiation Debate"""" (which was your proposed section heading); he is on the extremes of that debate, which ranges from hormesis to LNT and onward, until you get to Busby, who is at the outer edge.

If you have some sort of idea why editing the """"Roman Polanski"""" to include the title of rapist is disruptive or vandalism you should explain why instead of just unilaterally deciding that it is.

There are many other Wikipedia articles that are very similar with respect to people who are known for many different things, one of which is some sort of criminal act or acts. These articles include titles like, rapist, criminal, pedophile, murderer, thief, organized crime boss and many others. Just look at the OJ Simpson article, it makes reference to accusations against him for murder in the first sentence. Where this title is seems to be at issue for some reason. Wikipdeia articles are usually vastly different in their writing style and sometimes titles are places in different places throughout the articles. Since there is no debate as to whether Roman Polanski is a rapist or not, and since it is the one thing major thing he is known for outside of his movie career should it not be included in the first sentence? Is there a specific guideline as to where in an article a specific title that someone has earned throughout their life should be placed? Should a person's most prominent title be their career, their ethnicity, place of origin, or some other adjective that describes a notable feature of their life? What specific guideline specifies this? Should it merely be what the person is best known for, because Roman Polanski is very well known for having raped a 13 year old girl and for being a movie director.

I'm was thinking that the parts would be something like this: 0 - Create a draft of the project; recruit some editors to do phase 1. 1 - Move REALLY FAST to create campaign articles (template/shell/skeleton/whatever) for all competitive races where an incumbent won or there was an open race. Copy the info from articles on challengers into the campaign articles. Then slap redirects on the articles on challengers (if of questionable notability) so that there is no need for AfDs for these. (Such AfDs are bad precedent, in general a waste of time regardless of outcome, and successful AfDs could kill off source info.) 2A - Refine the phases of the project and what needs to be done - for example, what a really good campaign article might contain (polls, snapshots of campaign funding at various points, results, newspaper endorsements, a good selection of links to local newspaper stories, etc.) 2B - Create campaign articles for all competitive races where a challenger defeated the incumbent. 2C - Finish the 50-100 campaign articles for 2006 House races. That might include a rating/evaluation of the quality of each article. 2D - (Optional) - do the same for the 30+ Senate races. (I just looked at the Florida Senate campaign article the other day - except for the polling info, it's devoid of any significant content except primary results.) 3 - Improve the quality of wikipedia bio articles for incumbents in competitive races (defeated or not), winning challengers, and notable but not-winning challengers: good citations, good copyediting, etc., as baseline for 2008. 4A - (Starting mid-2007?) Build a 2008 comprehensive master page, and set up campaign articles for every race expected to be competitive/notable (that is, every race listed on the master page). Evaluate feasibility of doing transclusions from individual campaign articles rather than updating the master page directly. (There are both human and technical issues here, I believe). 4B - Recruit editors to take responsibility for maintaining each (individual) campaign article. Ideally we can find 3 or 4 editors who are (a) local and (b) can work together well, for each campaign (race) expected to be notable in 2008. Your thoughts? | Talk"

ok,""" While I take your recommendation to heart, I have to insist that, by any plain reading of WP:NFCC#1, the image is keepable. Let's look at the test in NFCC #1 & evaluate this image: Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose. No free equivalent could be created to show what Berry looked like as a webcam pornographer at 16 or so no matter how we approach him as a 22-year-old anti-child pornography speaker & educator. If non-free content can be transformed into free material, this is done instead of using a fair-use defense. The only way I could see to accomplish that with this photograph would be to ask Berry to permit its release under GFDL. Permission would be impossible to obtain and it would be (to my mind) cruel even to ask Berry about it. Non-free content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. """"Acceptable quality"""" means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose. There is no freer equivalent available Berry will never be a teenager again, and, since his appearance as a teenager is one of the issues raised by his critics, letting the reader draw their own conclusion seems more prudent & more neutral than telling them one way or the other what to think. As a quick test, ask yourself: """"Can this image be replaced by a different one, while still having the same effect?"""" If the answer is yes, then the image probably does not meet this criterion. As the effect is inextricably tied to the age of the subject as depicted on the websites he administered, there is nothing that would have the same effect as depicting him as others saw him at the time. It is intrinsically true that Berry portrayed himself a particular way when operating his websites. The only neutrality we can have on the subject is to show the """"facts"""" Berry's image then and let the reader draw their own conclusion. What say you? No free equivalent. Non-free content is used only where no free equivalent is available or could be created that would serve the same encyclopedic purpose. If non-free content can be transformed into free material, this is done instead of using a fair-use defense. Non-free content is always replaced with a freer alternative if one of acceptable quality is available. """"Acceptable quality"""" means a quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose.

ok,""" Andrew, I was in two minds about including AD. The only reason to include it was because people are unused to three digit years. At least I am! ;) Anyway, I'm happy to see it go. I love simplicity, just won't surrender it unless clarity isn't thrown out with the bathwater. As I said, I'm content. Explaining the """"nearest 50 years"""" rule is great. ) Also, I was going to explain the contents were only as specific as chapter. You have done this in a very neat and clear way, thank you! Great to have you at work on things! Yes, I thought about linking the books or not. The main argument against was that it took so long to enter them! However, the point of linking every repeated entry in a sortable list imo is that people may sort on city, for example, to see manuscripts near their home, say. If they see that Thessalonians is in a university library 125 miles away, maybe they will click on the link to Thess to see what Wiki editors have said about the book. Instead of looking for the first instance of Thessalonians in the table, or trying to decipher the abbreviation they just click on the field in the record they are looking at. I agree about not over-Wiki-ing, especially in the body of an article, and especially if different words are given the same link. Tables, by their nature are speedy reference systems, I like the idea of giving people just one click to follow up locating a record of interest. One example of how I might use the table is to add a """"Textual criticism"""" section to articles on NT books that don't have one already. I'd sort the table by the Contents field (I know it's not perfect), view the data relevant to a book and click through to it. Another use is to check just what 1 Corinthians chapters 10-11 contain. That article actually has links to specific chapters. Some of us know what's in chapters, most won't. Though, admittedly, not all articles on NT books go to specifics on chapters, but maybe in time they will. Now the work is done, it seems like a pity to lose it. Rest assured, I'm not going to be writing articles with every second word Wikified. ;) """

ok,""":::Yworo, first you claim they are """"just as diverse"""", now you admit it """"it's not black and white"""". Which is it? My argument is that your claim is soapboxing, something not supported in the sources. There are no sources that say those other ideologies are """"just as diverse"""". Besides, the issue isn't about diversity, it's about how related they are, whether all the ideologies have common roots from which they all evolved, or whether they have distinct unrelated sources. The complete dearth of sources describing any one of those other ideological labels as being comprised of distinct ideologies with original unrelated sources is telling. They are not """"just as diverse"""". What is deficient about this argument? It makes no reliance on all sources about libertarianism making this observation. By the way, referring to the distinct ideologies as """"variants"""" does not preclude the possibility of them being distinct with separate/unrelated origins.No one is questioning the complexity of Conservatism et. al.

I hope that claims of original research and synthesis can now be put to rest as BOGUS. An old NY times article http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res;=9501E2DB133BEE33A25751C1A9669D94679ED7CF references the following quotes James Madison - Thus the pretext for a paper currency and particularly for making the bill a legal tender, either for public or private debt, was cut off Thomas Jefferson - I now deny their (Congress's) power of making paper money, or anything else, a legal tender A Mr Benton who is also cited, states: The power granted to Congress to coin money is an authority to stamp metallic money, and is not an authority for emitting slips of paper containing promises to pay money. Per Yale Law School records of the minutes of the vote to TAKE AWAY from Congress the power to """"emit bills of credit"""" during the Constitutional Convention as recorded by Founding Father and future president James Madison http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_816.asp FN23 This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, [FN24] and particularly for making the bills a tender [FN24] either for public or private debts. and """"Mr. Ghorum was for striking out, without inserting any prohibition. if the words stand they may suggest and lead to the measure."""" My aside: The power to be struck out was the power to """"emit"""". Mr. Ghorum, (Madison misspelled the name - the person is actually Nathanial Gorham) states that if the words stand (the words being """"emit bills of credit"""") that """"they may suggest and lead to the measure"""" with the measure being printing legal tender paper money. To be ABSOLUTELY clear, this vote denied Congress the power to """"emit"""" per money, and strikes at the core of arguments in favor of paper money, because Congress cannot make paper money a legal tender because the power to print paper money was REMOVED from Congress. If Congress cannot even print paper money, how can it make it legal tender? In Federalist 44 - Madison states The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it. From Craig v Misouri The whole was intended to exclude everything from use as a circulating medium except gold and silver''', and to give to the United States the exclusive control over the coining and valuing of the metallic medium. That the real dollar may represent property, and not the shadow of it. From the dissenting opinion to one of the Legal Tender cases http://supreme.justia.com/us/79/457/case.html - starts with THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting'Acts of Congress not made in pursuance of the Constitution are not laws.We perceive no connection between the express power to coin money and the inference that the government may, in any contingency, make its securities perform the functions of coined money, as a legal tender in payment of debtsIt is unnecessary to say that we reject wholly the doctrine, advanced for the first time"

toxic,"What a hypocrite this creep Chavez is! From the main article about Hugo Chavez: Ch?vez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Ch?vez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health. I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!"

If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

In addition, Hill's Hearts of Space Web site (www.hos.com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one-hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music."""" The claim as I understand it (maybe I don't), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis/OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder's detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a """"commercial entity's branding drive"""". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame. Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered, but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives. Its niche music sales amount to less than 1% of the commercial market, so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising. (The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary, and then removed for synthesis/OR, should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload.) I suppose all this would give some reason for caution in using these sources, and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double-source things and to give all sides where sources disagree, but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source. Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre, or about his own show, he's primary. Where he's writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. - | Talk I agree with on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic. On the primary/secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show. On third-party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he'd be a secondary source. I'd say that within his area of expertise, there's no reason not to use his work as a reliable source. Just to be clear about the encyclopedia-margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying: Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert-based secondary sources via WP:V(WP:SPS). The Wikipedia art/music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art/music genre knows subjectively more about what he/she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion. You are changing that. What a secondary source says can be combined in a point-by-point source-provable editorial analysis. In this case, since there are so few other mainstream sources, many or most of them are presently combined with Hill's previous secondary source expertise to write the article. But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source. What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis, even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t"

""""Marcel Kazemi, the known german-iranian Crown prince of Birjand born and living in Gorgan, was also the last german after the islamic revolution"""", this sentence is meaningless, if not ridiculous. what it means that he is the last German after the revolution? Neither Dr. Sahedi nor anyone else is called """"notable figure"""" because of owning three hospitals.

What is """"Literature: Gorgan Nameh"""" ? Is that a news paper? Is that a book? Is that a literary book? Who has written it? Just throwing in a name is not, I suppose, of much use. Let's make this page more informative and more clear. Dear Mtdashti, Salam Hamshahri? Thanks for your explanation and opinion. The Book """"Gorgan Nameh"""" written by Massihi and issued by Amir Kabir company I haven't here currently. It was renamed from 'Astarabad Nameh' to Gorgan Nameh. The old edition I have has no ISBN no. Maybe there exists a new issue. The different Names of Gorgan I have found in that book. These are correct. The meaning Astar resp. Sattar is setareh. There exists also a TV reportage and a book where all world cities with the name Starcity are listed on a line. All the persons I named I known self. And so I know they were Gorgani. The famous Kazemis lived in the street Shahid Beheshti ,the known 'Masrahe Talaii' building, and also in district 'Gorgan Pars'. They had much credit and eminence in the whole city. The only european and western foreigner which lived in Gorgan still up to the end of the war. Marcel was born here and attend the schools 'Nahal Enghelabe Eslami' and 'Shahid Motahari'. I've seen him also in TV during the visit of Rafsandjani. They were also the only relatives of the Shah in the city. The Tabatabi lived in Gorgan and was a Gorgani, so consequently his daughter is also a Gorgani. He was a very large man, very nice and helpful, had a bald head and weared a toupee.:) Had the same face as his daughter. His only land property was here in Gorgan. Soochte Sarayi, I don't know how his name is written in english was a very known person but I can't find an english web page for him. Because he was in the era of the revolution a world champion no one from the young generation know him any more. All the persons are dead and so I thing I can't write more about them. Dr. Sahedi was a very deserved man in Gorgan's medical society. He repaired even self the X-ray devices and enabled so the function of the hospitals during the war. He died thereafter due to radiation in Tehran. A plate commemorated on him in the portal of the hospitals. What a pity I've forgotten the name of the most powerful only ruling Mullah of Gorgan. Maybe anybody else know it. Maybe a list of the Mayors is also interesting for the future. If you want make the page more informative, we should set only a link to another topic with the famouse persons of the city? It would be better as a mix. So it's better to delete and displace all persons with except of governor and current mayor? Furthermore 'Torang Teppeh' is in samewise important like the Gorgan Wall. Are you the same mind? Thanks a lot Choda hafez Dear Alifalsafi, Thanks for your explanation. There is much to talk about. Of course these people that you named are (or were) important and known to Gorgani people, I agree with that, but here in this Wikipedia, we should mention people who are known in Iran, if not in the world.

ok,"Thank you for your kind reply. Judging from the sources I have, I think the concept of spatial tense is only relevant in the context of the artificial language Lojban. The statement that several natural languages have spatial tense as defined in the article is still an unsubstantiated claim, so imho it should be pulled out pending evidence. Part of the problem is the very name of the concept. 'Tense' has the connotation of 'time'. In fact, grammatical tense is frequently (if loosely) defined as 'location in time'. Thus, it doesn't really make sense to talk about 'spatial tense'; it would be like talking about 'temporal place'. Since the only relevant use of the concept stems from Lojban grammar, I think it would be best to start the article out of the Lojban perspective, defining spatial tense as Lojban grammar defines it. And since spatial tense (according to Lojban grammar) is merely 'obligated expression of location', the broader context of the article should be the expression of space in language. And this is where observations about the connection between language and the way we perceive the world come in. The way I see it, the spatial cases of the Hopi language (one of the many languages that do very interesting things with space) don't really belong in an article about an invented, English-inspired, grammatical category. What we are really missing is a decent article about the way languages deal with location and space. Which is something I added to my to do list. ? (talk) 16:55, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)"

On the other hand, I think that the ideas of genitive pronouns and possessive adjectives should be kept seperate (considering English has both), considering that they're separate in both English and in West Germanic dialects in general (if they have both). 146.151.47.17, 11:33, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)"
ok,"?beda Hello, sorry for the long message. In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move ?beda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed). However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time. The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally. Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode). However, for ?beda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to ?beda. My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting that was the whole purpose of the survey. In discussion with him, I wrote: Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues. See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed). As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask: Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey? Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond."

ok,"Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement. Any choice of target redistributes from some groups to others - making some worse off. For example, high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt - including pensioneers, holders of fixed income securities, employees with protected jobs and annuity-like compensation (including most government employees, and policy makers, and most tenured academics), and creditors. It benefits net debtors - particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest rate caps. It also benefits owners of commodities, real estate, foreign currencies, equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed. Low inflation benefits holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country, importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees, and policy makers). Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers - increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets, and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate, owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed. In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement), however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical. To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies. Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities and real estate, and the precariously employed If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move an economy away from an efficient frontier. Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the form of a secure fixed annuity. This would incentivize them to favor tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth. Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly loose monetary policy. Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their overall moral hazard."

You say that everything you write there is sourced; for the sake of the argument, I shan't dispute that (even though a very good point is raised there, regarding the difference between sourced and attributed). However, sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability. Soapboxing, advocating and giving undue weight, on the contrary, are not permitted under Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. So, even if everything you state there is sourced, it still can't be included if it violates WP:NPOV. It's not a matter of not liking what sources have to say; it's just that they are only opinions. I don't think criticism should be hidden or Amanda's guilt taken for granted. Actually, I don't even know if she did it, because, quite frankly, I never studied the case, but I'm convinced that if a Court of law convicted her, there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that. Italy's not Soviet Russia... My point is that the article shouldn't mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guede's reputation, by implying that he was a lone killer, as that, primarily, violates WP:BLP. Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda. As I've said, I agree that criticism should be reported; it is notable and rather easily sourced. However, that should not be the focus of the article.

Dunphy was devastated by the infidelity and blamed it for his change in sexual orientation.

ok,""" As WP:OI says, Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy. The published information which is the basis for the annotation (i.e. the three letters/arrows) is explained on the image description page for the uncropped map and also in a footnote to the map's caption i.e. Macmillan gives the steps in setting a blast, the location and circumstances of the accident, and the location of Gage's lodgings and Harlow's home and surgery.. Thoughts on this? As with the image links, I've put the map back so we (and others) can see what we're talking about. A9 Proving a negative This regards a recent edit to the passage Macmillan's comprehensive survey of accounts of Gage (scientific and popular) found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes... which removed the word comprehensive. This is a delicate point and I want to come up with something everyone can live with. I think there are two questions here. First, Was Macmillan's analysis indeed comprehensive? No one who's been participating have any doubt on that, but just in case, open the collapse list. """"first rate example of carefully done historical work"""" (Psychological Reports, 2001) """"obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered (Cortex, 2004) """"fastidious archaeological removal of the layers of legend"""" (Lancet, 2001) """"Even some of the most prestigious academic researchers have disseminated erroneous information..."""" (Neurosurgery Quarterly, 2002) """"The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""" (Science, 2000) """"Macmillan scoured all the sources and commentaries on the case and as far as material regarding Gage is concerned this must be a definitive work. (History of the Human Sciences, 2007) """"Macmillan has shown that the record of how Phineas Gage?s character changed after the accident must be considered with caution..."""" (New England Journal of Medicine"""", 2004) Second, Do we need to say the analysis was comprehensive? IMO I think we do, because it the analysis assserts a negative, which requires extraordinary research; just saying Macmillan found no mention omits that such extraordinary research was in fact done. (Two examples from the collapse box: """"Macmillan has obstinately searched all possible sources. It seems very unlikely that anyone else could find a relevant piece not considered""""; """"The definitive account. One of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary."""")Without such a clear statement, we get edit summaries such as this one: . Actually, there's a third question: Do we need to include a quotation (such as the """"further research is not necessary"""" above) supporting the comprehensiveness? I don't think the reader needs that. I had put it in a footnote to the article recently only because another editor had questioned the comprehensiveness in other words, the quotation was there for editors, not readers, and this discussion can take its place. So what I suggest is that the article say Macmillan's comprehensive analysis of accounts of Gage...'', where [97][98][99] cite to a few of the sources supporting the comprehensiveness, but without quoting them.

Pilz' """"early anouncements"""", had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his """"extraordinarily reliable Agent D"""" report. So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner. He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani. As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple. So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time? And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports. Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance. I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary """"contributors"""" to the same smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.

Your recent comments make it appear that you're tired of having to answer the same questions again and again, which I can relate to.

They are coming in under good faith, trying to help, however misguided that help may be. IMHO, we could gain more protectors and contributors to the article and any future content issues, by welcoming them and helping to bring them up to speed on the current issues. At the moment, I haven't found any qualifications to answering RfC's, and officially, wikipedia doesn't require anyone to know the rules to edit. So there are probably going to be more people coming in with similar suggestions, who have little or no knowledge of Norse mythology or the origins of Trolls. I know it's tiring, but it's also not going to be the end of the world if we take the time to educate new editors in a tactful manner.

ok,"Babak and Persians Hey Tajik, thanks for the BBC article. I did want to talk to you though with regards to the stuff going with the Persians. I noticed some activity there and realized that someone has added Tajiks as 'Persians', which in effect negates the Tajiks page. Now the problem with this is the article on the Persians will turn into a massive article describing cultural variations and divergent histories etc. I'm not sure this is a good way to go. Tajiks are indeed Persians, but are as distinct as the Slovaks are from the Czechs or the Croats from Serbs (both groups speak mutually intelligible languages or basically the same language). In addition, as you well know, many, if not most, don't call themselves Persians anyway (most I've met refer to themselves as Afghans or will talk of their 'Aryan' lineage). The way we've set it up, on Iranian peoples was good in that we had Tajiks as a sub-type of Persians (which I believe you put in), and thus can have their own article as both a closely related type of Central Asian Persians and as an Iranian people with many distinct qualities of their own (linking them more to Persians in northeast Iran rather than those of western Iran), including the Tajiks of Tajikistan. In addition, most references distinguish between the two, while clarifying Tajiks as an Iranian people, usually referred to as Central Asian Persians. In short, after all this, I think it's a huge mistake to subsume the Tajiks given the weight of history and divergence that has taken place simply due to the vast geographic expanse and the Tajiks own unique qualities.

Also Christian coalitions have core requirements like acceptance of the Divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, Holy Trinity, Ressurection and Salvation through grace, personal relation to J.C. etc. Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, etc, don't accept all of these.

ok,"""talk)]] Zoe, thank you for the kindness of your reply. I can't help wondering if your answer is to the point, however, since my question was about the use of in articles and the reference you cite is about the talk pages. Moreover, it seems not to discuss comments. DreamGuy cites the use of comments in Wica (see his edit summary). I might add Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. These examples suggest to me that some use of comments may be appropriate in articles. The Katrina article was edited frequently by many distinct editors. I don't think comments would have been retained without support for their use. I wonder if you might be willing to reply to my query regarding the comment wording (and caps use) that I proposed in my previous message? May I say that I don't agree with the reversion by DreamGuy of your deletion of my comments? My preference is to resolve this matter through discussion and dialogue. Best wishes, (talk) (... two editors want them here, one does not, so far that means the two editors win.... these guidelines are useful and used elsewhere, so no reason to remove them) copied from editorial summary DreamGuy (Talk) As a gesture of good faith, I'm going to put the wording I proposed above into the article in place of my original wording. I think my original might be considered shouting because of use of caps. Zoe and DreamGuy, please show restraint and don't revert my wording for now. Once we've agreed on a final version, one of us can edit the article to suit. Zoe, is there an editor whose judgement you trust that might be willing to take a look at this dispute and comment? Thank you both, (talk) In fiction and In music consensus The consensus (painfully) reached here is that the In fiction and In music sections should contain short representative lists of the most notable instances of chimera in fiction and music (see the article edit history and the arbitration on the article discussion page). These sections should not include every instance since the lists would become so long as to have little or no value and would give the impression that such uses are more important than mythical or scientific uses. Wikipedea is not mere collections of internal links. See what not to put on disambiguation pages, as well. Consequently, before adding to this section, please take the following steps: be sure that the article that you are linking mentions chimera. We should not be sending readers that are looking for information about chimera to articles that do not mention the term. verify that your addition is at least as notable as the examples already listed and that chimera plays a major, not just a tangential role in the work. consider replacing an existing less-notable entry. justify your edit on this page. Finally, if you disagree with my opinion of the consensus, leave your comments here. Please don't edit the article to make your point. (talk) Page move request To move the page to its classical Latin spelling Chimaera. It is of course a classical creature / concept, which has nothing to do with the US, so why should it be at a recent US variant spelling? - I think this is a reasonable argument. On the other hand, the majority modern usage is with the Chimera spelling, I think. Google finds 3,230,000 (Chimera) v. 1,010,000 (Chimaera). If Google is an indication of use frequency among Internet users, a majority of readers will be searching for Chimera. That is a weak argument; redirects are relatively cheap, or so I think. (talk) Gee, why should it use a recent US spelling? Well, there's Wikipedia:Use English policy, Wikipedia:Naming conventions policy that say we use the most common version, and a conspicuous lack of any policy that says Wikipedia:Use archaic Latin. We spell it the way it's spelled in the real world, it's a little thing called Wikipedia:Use common sense. NEWLIN"

It would also be improved with the addition of a couple of pictures of Green playing basketball to go along with the bio box on the right side of the page. The article also fails to mention Green's father, who has many times gained as much attention as Danny and is a very significant story involving Danny that is not included in the article.

What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the """"dispute"""" with an act of vandalism in addition to the message """"You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name]. I want to see how much you can take before you crack."""" So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""". The """"Omega Point (Tipler)"""" article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ..."""" In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility. You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article. Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers. Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it. Because of this, this article and its associated talk page have recently been subject to vandalism and other disruptive behavior. Therefore, due to the foregoing reasons, you are here requested not to further engage in such factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating edits.

What really happens is that the node between the two caps gets charged up (or down, depending on whether the + or - ends are connected together) and stays charged, so that both caps are biased with sufficient dc that their voltage never goes negative. The reliable source we have cited there (app note from a cap manufacturer) says that you don't really need the diodes, because the caps will act as diodes and conduct in the reverse direction to accomplish that effect. I would think it would be more reliable to have that reversed current flow through a diode, but given that it's only a transient phenomenon as the cap charges up I can see that in some applications it could be acceptable to do it without the diodes."

obscene,""" HE BELIEVES IN OPENNESS BUT CLOSES HIS PAGE - BULL$HIT WE ALL SEE THRU U JIMBO Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created. On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden. Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay. So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes. Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card. """"There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission. And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER. Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment."""

ok,"Hello user at address 90.184.243.14, Hello user at address 90.184.243.14, Hmmm... I don?t really agree with your comments. I guess the disagreement boils down to what we think that Wikipedia stands for. I was under the impression that one of the aims of Wikipedia was that it allowed information to be distributed freely worldwide and not to be controlled by commercialist corporations. You clearly disagree with this perception. I take your point that the H-K adsorption isotherm isn't as popular as Langmuir & BET but the equation is peer reviewed and used by a number of research groups. Taking the info off the adsorption website would consign this peer reviewed equation to books and journals that people would have to pay to access. I see this action as being very much against the Wikipedia ethos and think that the text should be reinstated immediately. Moreover, if possible I think that people should be encouraged to add other ?lower status? equations to the webpage so that as much information as possible is disseminated free of charge. Regarding the text being written in a journal style format: does it really matter as long as it communicates the workings of the equation?"

ok,"Categories in Being and Categories Manifested Not to reinvent the wheel, but it seems atom of category content is 'article title';each atom can have one or more 'membership tags'. The membership tags EACH, indivdually IMPLY a category; for example, for author Xysys &writers; &American; &woman; &novelist; &short-story-writer; &essayist; &criticism; &historical-novels; &commedy-of-manners-novels; &post-modern-short-stories; &childern;'s-short-stories Rather than a fixed list of Catagory: articles the user is served a page of tags that gives the ability to drag and drop to build a category. And then that intersection is created. And served to the user [with the index bar to choose by initial letter of last name of the author article. In the simplest case that might be all writers; a potentially gigantic list, BUT ONLY ONE PAGE IS RETRIEVED AND SERVED. More complex intersections require more preprocessing but a shorter potential list, but still just 1 page served. Statistics will quickly identify the most used sets of intersections and THOSE sets will be preprocessed ahead of need. A user can build, on-the-fly a category of 'American Old White Men Agrarian Movement Novelists' as easily as a category of Post-Feminist Puertoricano Independencias Novelists. There will be a system learning curve that results in the most requested categories being preprocessed and ready-to-go. The user should have the ability to save the list of intersecting categories for further use. And, of course an 'Advanced Mode' could include boolean operators allowing queries like American Women Novelists who do NOT write children's books. From what I see now (IF I see correctly), categorization puts a big burden on categorizers who evidently can be pretty divorced from the subject matter. How much better a tag system more or less under the wing of the appropriate subject group. I really think this kind of approach might be about as neutral as categorization can become. It might be interesting to try this in a relatively small field; say 'American Novelists'"

It lets a child try many different learning aspects to fully realize the potential one has. All of the classes are tied together in some way. The teachers work together to match classes.

Are we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade-level vocabulary into it as a means of providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to """"dumb down"""" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there's Simple English to cater to that need. So, that's my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don't know what a word means, just look it up. -Alan 24.184.184.130 03:10, 1 December"""

TheocracyWatch quotes Glenn Scherer saying that Eagle Forum has rated some US Senators differently from environmentalist groups. Mother Jones said that Eagle Forum has supported a Republican group, and some of those Republicans had once supported Pat Robertson. That is very far removed from Eagle Forum supporting Dominionism. If Eagle Forum says that environmentalism is contrary to the Bible, or if Eagle Forum supported Pat Robertson for president, then those things might be notable and criticism of those views might be notable.

ok,"(undent) This was previously discussed quite a bit at this talk page. See Archive 9. The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article. The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright. Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life. If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article. There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut. Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee."

GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked and put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol 21:51, 6"

A more specific way to identify English people might be to assert that they must have some belief in a shared common ancestry with other people living in what is now England, though this is a subjective belief because all human groups have a demonstrable close and recent shared ancestry.

ok,""" Midway = turning point In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack. I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor) 2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war. 3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN. 4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses. But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling. So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway. Ferrocephalus (talk) """

ok,""" I have found the original answer in the archives garbage historic, after intervention of T?bel, here it comes: Dear Val, who is also a mormon [or a parrots, 'ain't sure] I found very strange that each time I am answering to one wikipedian/mormons question, it is another who react to it instead of the one to whom it is adress to. I do not see why you are defending stand point who are not at all being made by you, nor why you feel the urge to respond for another one than you. I think that the person concern, Storm Rider, is grown up enough to do so on its own. Unless next time I am under attack, you take the relay and answer that one for me as well. It could be interesting. If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don't know what to say. So do the wisest, just shut up! It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. So if I take the name """"anonymous"""" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity. So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? It is all a lie. How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? It isnt equality it is power struggle. It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality! HA HA! Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as """"logic"""". For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. I speak 9 languages: English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek! 5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use. Like german I can read a book but I dont have spoken it for some years so it might take me 2 3 weeks to get back the rythm. As a nativ american your knowledge of foreign languages is zero, maybe hightened if you are a mormon who have been on mission outside the US, but you have absolutely no experience of the process of learning new languages. In europe from age 11 we choose between 3 languages: english german and spanish, at age 13, we have to chose another one, and choose between english german, spanish italian russian, from age 15, when we begin graduate school, we have to take another one, and chose between those named before and also chineese and modern american, and a dialect or local language, and can also take hebrew. 2 to 3 languages are part of the compulsory pensum. I also took extra english dialect as the one spoken by semi natives in australia, and english dialect spoken in India. That was for learning"

That view seems to be missing here. ...And by this date, certain members of the Milner Group and of the British Conservative government had reached the fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone by setting Germany and Russia against one another in Eastern Europe. In this way they felt that the two enemies would stalemate one another, or that Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Rumania and the wheat of the Ukraine. It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position that Germany and Russia might make common cause, even temporarily, against the West. Even less did it occur to them that Russia might beat Germany and thus open all Central Europe to Bolshevism. This idea of bringing Germany into a collision with Russia was not to be found, so far as the evidence shows, among any members of the inner circle of the Milner Group. Rather it was to be found among the personal associates of Neville Chamberlain, including several members of the second circle of the Milner Group. The two policies followed parallel courses until March 1939. After that date the Milner Group?s disintegration became very evident, and part of it took the form of the movement of several persons (like Hoare and Simon) from the second circle of the Milner Group to the inner circle of the new group rotating around Chamberlain...'' http://yamaguchy.netfirms.com/cikkek/anglo_12b.html"

ok,""" That is an interesting spin on your earlier comment: my views have """"zero validity"""" on my talk page, but """"100% validity"""" at an RFC. I am not sure I can make a cogent response to these conflicting statements. In answer to your question, I think it important to maintain clear personal boundaries when it comes to disputes between editors. Not accepting personal attacks is one such boundry, another is courtesy, and another is mutual respect. If these personal boundries break down, subsequent discussion can degenerate into generalised mudslinging, which I think is what happened with the RFC's I have been the subject of. These RFC's have brought accusations that are too generalised to either prove or refute. As a generalisation, it is generally a good idea to avoid accusations based on generalisations, because I would end up being painted in a bad light whether I particiated or not. With regard to the RFC, the lack of courtesy shown by not being notified of a draft being started is indicative of a lack of respect for myself, or at least that is my personal view (valid or not). Evidence support this view is indicated by the fact that if the proposers of the RFC were really interested in resolving their personal disagreements with me, they would have brought their pet peeves to this talk page first, and we could resolve them in an amicable way. Unfortunetly, that did not happen. I can only speculate why, but I think it has something to do with the inabilty of a group of editors (myself included) not being able to come to shared understanding of how notability applies to certain topics. I am a reasonable editor, and I am confident when it comes to disputes (personal or editorial), a that shared understanding of the issues involved can be reached. But it can only come about in an atmosphere of mutual respect and courtesy. (talk|contribs) """

But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw). So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author?s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around.

You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong. No 3RR violation on my part.

ok,"Courtney Here are my suggestions from my Peer Review of your article Chunking, (Psychology) by: Dan Hurlburt Considering the fact that this article was removed by a previous editor I just looked in the articles history and examined the latest edited form of the article before the changes were undone in order to complete my peer review. The lead section provides a good stand alone summary of Chunking, in psychology. The article already has a strong intro that didn?t require much editing in the form of adding new material. It did however, require some fine tuned modifications that I think she did a good job of locating and crossing out words and rephrasing sentences that needed to be more specific. The contribution does not seem to be cut and pasted from an existing source it flows well with the article and is properly placed. The terms used go along with the articles style well and are easy to understand. One sentence that sounds a little confusing when read is ?Runners may chunk the numbers into different relevant mile, or other distances, times.? May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across. In the Short term memory section the sentence: ?The short term memory processes (stores) information for about twenty to thirty seconds? I think needs a word or two added in, in order to complete the thought, I tried to include a suggestion. May need a little more elaboration just to clear up the point you are trying to get across. She relates to her references where it seems necessary. Even though the article already includes a decent amount of information she finds the areas that did need further elaboration and creates an appropriate section for the information. Grammar and verb tenses and spelling all match up well with the rest of the article. One area where a wiki link may help the article is in the section where she is talking about short term memory, possible link to Short Term Memory but I don?t think that it is necessary, since she does explain it a little using a reference. Her references match up well with the rest of the ones listed in the document in format and when investigating them, they all are relevant to the subject matter and provide useful information for the article. I don?t think that any images would enhance the article, considering the article already provides a good diagram that is explained well and fits the topic nicely."

Andrew Johnson Trial (1868): charges of impeachment were brought against Johnson who fired secretary of war, Edwin Stanton and replaced with Lorenzo Thomas. Accusers said that Johnson violated tenure of office act. Johnson was 1 vote short of being guilty, and supreme court ruled the act unconstitutional. Sig: Johnson made into lame duck president. 103. 14th amendment: gave citizenship to African Americans, established equal protection under law, ended 3/5ths compromise, denied ex-confederates the right to hold office, U.S. would not pay confederate debt or for loss of slaves, reversed Dred Scott case. 104.

Tilden of New York out polled Ohio's Rutherford Hayes in the popular vote, and had 184 electoral votes to Hayes' 185, with 20 votes yet uncounted. These 20 electoral votes were in dispute: in three states (Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina), each party reported its candidate had won the state, while in Oregon one elector was declared illegal (on account of being an """"elected or appointed official"""") and replaced. The 20 disputed electoral votes were ultimately awarded to Hayes after a bitter legal and political battle, giving him the victory. 110. Compromise of 1877: southern democrats would award Hayes the presidency if only the federal govt. removed all troops from former confederate states, for there to be at least one democrat in Hayes cabinet, a transcontinental railroad to build in the south, and the industrialization of the south.

The strikes quickly spread through railroads from St. Louis to the East Coast. ?

By the first week of August 1877, at least 100 strikers, militiamen, and bystanders had been killed, and hundreds had been injured; Millions of dollars of property had also been destroyed throughout the strikes. ?

In the years following, Gwyneth Paltrow and Liya Kebede also joined the company as models, rounding out 4 faces. Currently, the company is fronted by Murphy, Hillary Rhoda, Paltrow and Hurley. The phrase 'lesser capacity' is misleading. Hurley models perfume, cosmetics and skincare for the company, something which Ms Murphy does not do (she does not model cosmetics), nor does Ms Paltrow (who does not model skincare). Only Ms Rhoda models all 3 as Ms Hurley does, but Ms Rhoda does not serve as the face of Estee Lauder's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign. Thus, it is not that Hurley works in a 'lesser' capacity, she simply works in a 'different' capacity, in actual fact, her workload has increased!

I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do. I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face. Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate. I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below. If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to? because I wouldn't? because I have no reason to? because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid.

You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of. 2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane. 3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit: You take leaders/favorites? who take favorites? who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening. 2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment. Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. We all want what we shouldn't have. Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have. 5. How you go about it is the wrong way. Some things people must learn for themselves.

toxic,"re webquest help links removed I can't believe how you people run this place. WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month. NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up???

ok,"Reply To the best of my knowledge, Scarlett Heights is a semester school http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/schools/schools/docs/semesteredschools.pdf along with Silverthorn, Thistletown and North Albion. Weston is not really in the region. The article implies that students from as far as Rexdale come to Kipling because of its semestered nature. However, such students would have several closer alternatives. Something else must be attracting such students. The daily announcements used to be presented on Switch-On on a daily basis. Currently Switch-On is produced only on Thursdays. The rest of the week, the daily announcements are read by a student over the P.A. system. The Switch-On program may return to a daily production next year. Varsity Outdoor cricket is the only official TDSB version of the sport. Indoor cricket is unique to the schools of the former boards of Etobicoke and York. Since it is not played in all districts, it is not officially sanctioned by the board. However, you are correct that the local indoor league is divided into JR and SR divisions. I see no problem in stating that a significant number of the school?s students are of Somalian Origin, and that the school has made strong effort to work with and connect with the Somalian community. However, most of the Somalian students now in the school were born in Canada. Current refugees are more likely to be from Afghanistan. The demographic of schools like Kipling quickly changes, therefore it is difficult to keep specific statements like ?200 Somalian refugees? current. Why not leave the article more general to better reflect the mosaic of cultures represented within the school. The YOUCAN program is not an in-house program. It is run by a private, paid organization. Originally the program was delivered to small groups of students who showed interest and leadership potential. Roger Dale introduced the program first to small groups, then to all grades nines, then eventually participation became mandatory for all registered students. Kipling was the first school to require full participation within this program. With the apparent, impending requirement for all schools to offer ?Character Education? YOUCAN may be positioning itself to become a provider for other TDSB schools. Perhaps this is why a link was suggested between the introduction of YOUCAN and the drop in the Kipling suspension rate. However, the prime reason for the drop in suspension rate is that Roger Dale does not believe in the value of suspensions and is a proponent of Progressive Discipline and Restorative Justice as alternatives and prerequisites to suspension. http://www.tdsb.on.ca/pandp/ppdocs/docs/P/P064%20SCH.pdf The suspension rate for Kipling and its neighbouring academic schools for 2006-2007: Kipling 2.2 % Martingrove 2.5% Richview 2.8% Scarlett Heights 9.7%. http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/parents/safe_schools/docs/Schools%20by%20Alpha.pdf"

ok,"Block I have just been blocked by user FeloniousMonk for issues surrounding the entry on Christopher Michael Langan. This entry has been fraught for some months, but my contribution has been confined to the last week or so. I acted several days ago on a longstanding request by the subject of the entry to remove what he considers a potentially libelous section of the entry. User Jimbo Wales judged the section to be blatant original research and deleted the section. This followed many months in which several editors, including FeloniousMonk, refused to see any problem with the section. Some editors were needless to say displeased with this correct decision by Mr Wales, and argued against it, although they did not try to re-place the deleted section. I have provided extensive arguments on various other content issues to do with the entry. Progress was being made toward improving the article, but some users whom I consider clearly biased against the subject of the entry, had difficulty accepting these arguments. Other editors agreed with my arguments, which were extensively but politely put. Some editors changed their position on some issues, such as the issue of whether to include certain links, which user Arthur Rubin originally opposed the inclusion of (deleting them with little reason given), later acknowledging that inclusion of the links was legitimate. FeloniousMonk is an editor involved with the entry, and he is blocking for reasons of a content dispute. This is in violation of policy. In addition, he has not provided any arguments why my edits are sanctionable. I do not believe there was a problem with my edits, the vast majority of which were confined to the talk page of the entry, and I would ask any administrator to examine my record. My userpage contains some links at the bottom to recent important edits in relation to this entry, including many by myself. Some users implied that I was in fact a sock-puppet for the subject of the entry. I realised just before this block was placed that a checkuser request was conducted a couple of days ago that showed I was unrelated to Langan. I in fact live outside the United States, do not know the subject, am not a proponent of his ideas, and am not a proponent of intelligent design. I have stated this previously on several occasions.

ok,"""==Rory== Is her son reading PPE, Modern History, or Modern History and Politics (MHP)? All three have been mentioned (including the non-existent """"history and politics and history""""). It is sometimes the case that an admissions tutor might suggest that a candidate accepts a place for a subject other than that for which he or she has applied, although I think that is most likely to happen when the candidate has applied for a Joint School and is thought to be better suited to just one of the subjects it includes, e.g. an applicant for Philosophy and Theology might be offered Theology (there is no School of Philosophy); I suppose it is possible that it was doubted whether he was suitably qualified to read the philosophy and economics aspects of the course and, since there is no School of Politics, it would be possible only to offer a Joint School including politics, of which the only one currently offered is MHP (presumably he would have been considered well qualified for Modern History). It isn't the case that PPE is more """"coveted"""" (or even """"coverted""""!) than MHP; rather, that more applicants aspire to read it. I suppose those applicants (and later those who were unsuccessful) do covet reading PPE, but I imagine that MHP applicants covet a place to read MHP. Perhaps PPE is quantitively more coveted, but I think that unless MHP students secretly covet the opportunity of reading PPE, it isn't really an appropriate description. All that might be said is that PPE is long-established and is currently thought to be a good preparation for future life. When the PPE School was in its infancy it was regarded as a very poor School, though not as poor as English Language and Literature, about which it was commonly asked whether one could really justify a university teaching English literature (English language was less controversial, which is why the early course placed such great emphasis on language rather than literature) - one might say that English was the old media studies. Today, English is considered one of the most respectable university degree subjects. Modern History used to be considered second after Literae Humaniores and is still a highly respected School (in fact, all Schools at Oxford are highly respected, notwithstanding criticism sometimes directed against Classical Archaeology and Ancient History). Presumably the earlier information about Rory Campbell reading MHP was incorrect, or he has managed to change his course, which is not uncommon, although it would seem strange for a student to be allowed to change to a course for which he or she had previously been rejected. Is it actually important to mention that Fiona Millar's son is reading PPE at Balliol? Many hundreds of people have read PPE at Balliol, so it is hardly a thing of any interest in itself. Perhaps if Fiona Millar had previously been an opponent of PPE (very unlikely), or of Oxford (or Oxbridge) (a distinct possibility), or indeed of Balliol (unlikely but a remote possibility), it would be of interest. However, nothing in the article suggests that she holds, or has ever held, anti-Oxford/Oxbridge views. If the suggestion being made was that her son had gained admission to Balliol because of the importance of his parents and in spite of being """"widely regarded as a top class idiot"""", I would think that the allegation is unkind, probably unfounded, and almost certainly impossible to prove. The only way in which it could be included here would be if it was stated in some other source, such as a newspaper article. """

There is no point about the affirmative action reference, as I said in the previous post.

ok,"WP:GUNS importance assessment As you surmised, the ten percent standard is intended to be interpreted as an order of magnitude, rather than a difference between a disqualified 9 percent and a qualified 11 percent. I am certainly open to alternative suggestions to clarify the criterion; but I disagree about the absence of sources to define an order of magnitude quantification. The American gun culture includes a large number of writers who emphasize opinions rather than pursuing statistics. As the internet allows anyone to screen for information sources confirming an existing bias, such authors may be well represented by conventional search-engine algorithms. I personally enjoyed articles by Elmer Keith and Jack O'Connor relating divergent first-hand experiences hunting with light or heavy bullets; but I sought out articles by Julian Hatcher to find results of side-by-side scientific method comparisons. I believe sources are available to quantify the features qualifying as top importance articles. It may be difficult to find quantification in the popular press (including the anti-gun press); but well-researched sources are worth the effort required to find them. Assessment of importance requires a fundamental understanding of the subject; and the amount of time required will vary inversely with the experience of the editor. I wouldn't encourage you to undertake this assessment task with an unrealistic impression of the knowledge or time required. As a practical matter, however, you may understand the subject well enough to know the answer after reading the article. If you think the subject represented more than ten percent of the firearms or ammunition, it's probably a top importance article; but it's probably not top importance if you have doubts. I doubt your decisions on that basis will be challenged; but it shouldn't be an unreasonable task to find documentation on the few which might be."

Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period. Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons: The way you did it: The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".

In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block. The reasons why you did it: It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page. You neither told me not to remove that stuff. I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude. I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request. In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above. And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.

ok,""" JIDF posts image for Wikipedia Here's a situation I found intriguing. The JIDF blog specifically posted an image to put on this Wikipedia article. The heading currently reads """"Better Sample of the Groups We Target (For Wikipedia)."""" This strikes me as problematic. At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.) I'm sorry if you've already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting nuance. Best wishes, | Talk I don't like the way the JIDF is manipulating this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blog is a WP:RS for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. ? Malik Shabazz (talk ? contribs) Hm. That's interesting. The JIDF is only marginally notable (only two major press citations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn't display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a logo, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance. Maybe we should drop that image. It looks like the JIDF doesn't want to be on Wikipedia after all. ? Malik Shabazz (talk ? contribs) At this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I'm assuming that WP:BLP does not apply to organizations, right?) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I'd be interested in hearing the pro's and con's for keeping the image. (Aside from the promotional concern I've floated above.) Tx, | Talk I think there may be copyright problems, because (for example) the Hamas logo is subject to copyright. I've brought the question up at Wikipedia:Copyright problems. ? Malik Shabazz (talk ? contribs) The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don't have screenshots. They don't even have pictures other than the logo, and those are organizations with physical offices, known officers, and big real-world events. The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home/login page. Miniclip has a screen shot of their huge home page in their info box. LinkedIn just has a logo. Myspace has a logo and a picture of the headquarters building. None of these Wikipedia pages have screenshots of interior web site pages. Wikipedia doesn't usually do that. But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. So it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group's activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blog sites? After all, it could as well be an independent screenshot of the targeted group, without JIDF as the source. See what I mean? | Talk Just to clarify, there was already a sample up. I read the blog and they made a point saying that the original sample only showed anti-semitic groups and not the terrorist groups, and I wanted to learn how to add an image, so I replaced it. I don't care if there's a photo up or not, but I do feel if there's going to be one, that it should be the most accurate"

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement? With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter.

They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat! And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August! And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it! DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA! How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! NO! Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal!

ok,"""The-Pope]]==== By stating """"Comments about the opinions and supposed motivations of other editor will be removed"""" you are completely missing the point. We have some people in the Australian community (both on and of wiki) who only call the round ball game football (or maybe association football) and get offended/upset/angry by the word soccer due to previous negative connotations of the word. Others use the word football exclusively for another code, most commonly Australian rules football, and only use soccer (without any intended offence) for the round ball game. Then you have another group who are happy to use either term, depending on context or to avoid any possible ambiguity. What proportion of the population is in each group depends on location, age, era, ethnicity/cultural background, etc. So there is no single consensus. I'm for soccer if it avoids confusion of codes (such as a in a multi-sport stadium article or a suburb article), but using football is ok if a dedicated article (such as a team or player article), all with a piped link to association football (a term which is rarely used and can also be ambiguous in parts Australia with Australian rules football games played in competitions named Associations such as the Victorian Football Association). Extrapolating the no move decision in that RM about a single parent article to apply to every mention of the sport is invalid, in my opinion. Achieving a true consensus is near impossible because we aren't a homogenous society. ====[[User:"""

ok,""" South Korea started the war The events now taking place in Korea broke out on June 25 as the result of a provocative attack by the troops of the South Korean authorities on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. This attack was the outcome of a premeditated plan. From time to time Syngman Rhee himself and other representatives of the South Korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique had such a plan. As long ago as October 7, 1949, Syngman Rhee, boasting of success in training his army, stated outright, in an interview given to an American United Press correspondent, that the South Korean Army could capture Pyongyang in the course of three days. On October 31, 1949, Sin Sen Mo, Defence Minister of the Syngman Rhee Government, also told newspaper correspondents that the South Korean troops were strong enough to act and take Pyongyang within a few days. Only one week before the provocative attack of the South Korean troops on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, Syngman Rhee said, in a speech on June 19 in the so-called """"National Assembly"""" where Mr. Dulles, adviser to the U.S. State Department, was present: """"If we cannot protect democracy in the cold war, we shall win in a hot war."""" It is not difficult to understand that representatives of the South Korean authorities could only make such statements because they felt that they bad American support behind them. One month before the present developments in Korea, on May 19, 1950, Mr. Johnson, chief American administrator of aid to Korea, told the American Congress House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that 100,000 officers and men of the South Korean Army, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American Military Mission, bad completed their preparations and could begin war at any time. It is known that only a few days before the Korean events, the United States Defence Secretary, Mr. Johnson, the Chief of the General Staff of the United States Armed Forces, General Bradley, and the State Department adviser, Mr. Dulles, arrived in Japan and had special conferences with General MacArthur, and that afterwards Mr. Dulles visited South Korea and went to frontier areas on the 38th Parallel. Only one week before the events-on June 19-Mr. Dulles, adviser to the State Department, declared in the above-mentioned """"National Assembly"""" of South Korea that the United States was ready to give all necessary moral and material support to South Korea which was fighting against Communism. These facts speak for themselves and need no comment. . . . The United States Government tries to justify armed intervention against Korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the authorisation of the Security Council. The falsity of such an allegation strikes the eye. What really happened? It is known that the United States Government had started armed intervention in Korea before the Security Council was summoned to meet on June 27, without taking into consideration what decision the Security Council might take. Thus the United States Government confronted the United Nations Organisation with a fait accompli, with a violation of peace. The Security Council merely rubber-stamped and back-dated the resolution proposed by the United States Government, approving the aggressive actions which this Government had undertaken. . . . The illegal resolution of June 27, adopted by the Security Council under pressure from the United States Government, shows that the Security Council is acting, not as a body which is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace, but as a tool utilised by the ruling circles of the United States for unleashing war. This resolution of the Security Council constitutes a hostile act against peace. If the Security Council valued the cause of peace, it should have attempted to reconcile the fighting sides in Korea before it adopted such a scandalous resolution. Only the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General could have done this. However, they did not make such an attempt, evidently knowing that such peaceful action contradicts the aggressors' plans. http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1950-gromyko-korea.html"""

ok,"December 2009 (UTC) It is not common (because almost every defendant in murder cases opts for a fast-track trial) but it may happen. A fast-track trial is a trial where no actual trial is involved. I'll try to explain it. A criminal proceeding in Italy consists of many phases: 1. preliminary investigations; 2. preliminary hearing; 3. trial; 4. appeals. After the preliminary hearing, the Judge only decides whether or not the evidence gathered so far is enough to sustain a case in Court. If so, he sends the defendant before the Judge of the Trial, where he will be convicted or acquitted; if not, the Judge sort of acquits the defendant. A defendant can, though, choose to give up his right to a trial. He will be, then, tried by the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing, who will hand down a judgement, based upon the evidence gathered so far. Since this is a reduction of the defendant's rights, it must be he who asks for a fast-track trial. In exchange for that, he is compensated with a lighter sentence. If there are two or more defendants, one may opt for a fast-track trial and the other choose to stick to the standard pattern. In this case, since it would be unfair (or so Italians think) to let the wishes of one of them take precedence over those of the other, the two defendants are tried separately, even though they committed the same crime. 14:05, 11"

The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely. The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it. The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin. The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against. They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered. The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed. The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source. If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?

This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality."""" What's the association between the two? Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here. I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.

ok,"Still, it's clear that Wulfila chose a lot of his spelling conventions based on those of Greek. Using ?? to write a long [i?] was certainly one of those conventions, and another clear example is using ? to represent [?]. He couldn't have based his choice of ?? on Greek (because there it was becoming [af] rather than a long vowel), but for ?? he probably was inspired by Greek. So what sound was ?? in the Greek of the time? Was it higher than ? or lower? The page Koine Greek phonology shows that both were in fact homophones and had been already for hundreds of years before. So if he took those two writing conventions from Greek, he did not take their pronunciations as they are different in Gothic. That means that we have to derive the pronunciations of those two vowels from loanwords. What letters does Wulfila use to substitute for ? in Greek loanwords? And what about Latin, which he no doubt knew as well? The Latin of the time had ? [?] and ? [e], length distinctions were probably disappearing (see Vulgar Latin). So what does Wulfila use for these two Latin sounds?"

That the citation author is unaware of the existence of something is not proof that it does not exist. I am unaware of the existence of cylindrical celled zinc-carbon batteries, but I would never make the claim that they don't exist In this case, the author of your reference is wrong. The centre battery in the illustration to the right is of a flat celled alkaline battery. Zinc-carbon (and indeed zinc-chloride) batteries are made using layer cells wrapped in a wax type coating, or even these days heat shrink plastic, for that is all that is required. Alkaline cells generate gas during discharge, which is absorbed by the chemistry, though there is a delay. As a result, some pressure does build up which requires a more substantial container. In virtually all alkaline constructions, that container is made from steel. Even a quick look at the centre battery shows rectangular cells made with steel containers. No manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries is going to go to that unnecessary expense. I have therefore reverted your edit. If you wish to continue to insist that there are no rectangular celled alkaline batteries, then please provide a citation that the construction is impossible. 212.183.140.5 Leclanch? cells To describe dry celled zinc-carbon as 'Leclanch?' is completely incorrect. Georges Leclanch? did not invent, build, or even conceive of a dry version of his famous cell. Indeed, the chemistry isn't even the same. The electrolyte in the Leclanch? cell is ammonium chloride. The (paste) electrolyte in the dry zinc-carbon battery is a 50:50 mix of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride. The difference gives the dry battery an e.m.f. of a little over 1.5 volts versus the Leclanch? 1.4 volts. Later, so called, high power versions of the cell dispensed with the ammonium chloride completely and just used zinc chloride. In any case, the most common name for this type of cell is the zinc-carbon and that should therefore be what it is refered to in the article. Few people (if anyone at all) call it anything other than a zinc-carbon. I also cannot find any manufacturer who describes it as 'Leclanch?'. I have therefore reverted this as well. 212.183.140.5"

This is my home town and I did a lot of research into it's history and everything so that I could make a good article on it. I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article. Anyways, the reason I'm bothering you with this is because you seem like you would probably know a little more about wikipolicy than me and I saw you get involved before.

I think that it is safe to assume that the IP that both Matthew2602 and the sockpuppeteer was dynamic, and used by multiple users. Perhaps other users were also unjustly blocked during that case; who knows. Once upon a time, I woke up one morning in July two years ago, only to find that I was blocked from editing on the only wiki that I was active on at the time, mylegonetwork.wikia.com. That wiki had about 20 active users then, and upon some very quick investigation it seemed that I had been caught up in the autoblock of a user who was blocked for one day for some minor policy violation. Anyways, I got an admin to unblock me and went on my merry way. A few hours later, when talking with him and other users on the IRC, I found out that he lives in the southern United States. I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months. I know that he is a good user with only good faith intentions, and I also know that he would like to be able to edit here again.

ok,"""==Why I don't edit often anymore== Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who """"defended"""" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn't worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle-aged jerk. As a parting bow in my too-long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman's character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade. About Peter Ekman Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right-wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn't fail. And for a long time Ekman didn't fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile. Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman's written work, but Ekman's response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile's added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get-away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape-shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson's Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo-nazi periodical. Ekman's evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled """"The eXile's Third Reich Uniform of the Week,"""" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform. Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he's occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia. The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman's crusade: Peter Ekman, Johnson's Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation In November 2000, in Issue #23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me. The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Moscow Times, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia. Taibbi characterized this approach as high-handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: """"Ekman has only one idea (""""Russia has a lot to learn from America""""), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight."""" The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a """"financial educator,"""" and described him as having """"a head seemingly worn bald from improper use."""" As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as-yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman's mother-in-law. Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson's Russia List to claim that """"the eXile is fascist and racist,"""" that """"every eXile issue contains unverifiable stories that smear someone's reputation,"""" that The eXile """"is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov."""" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile's Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile's publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper's satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been. Old Stuff """

I see only POV passions, googling for evidence to support them, and above, all, the tolerance on the page of sheer bad edits or nonsense that anyone with the slightest BA competence in Japanese studies would find laughable (I'm thinking of CurtisNaito in this regard). There are massive corrections to be made, but, as Ubikwit says, one simply doesn't have the time (at least for now), except to note that the litigants who do edit those pages, can't see the obvious (citing outdated sources like Fenellosa et al. from a century back,etc. I gave details a year ago why none of them are reliable, and suggested how to fix the sourcing: almost nothing done, and my edits are invariably to replace bad edits by giving several good sources, which, however anyone could do, if they had the foggiest idea of what Japanese scholarship knows). If there is competent area specialists available to review these messes, by all means get a third opinion from her, them. Nishidani (talk) Well, I also know this topic very thoroughly.' Sigh. I've had to correct virtually every edit I've seen you make, or revert every revert. True, you eventually accept nearly all of these improvements, after persisting on the talk page in justifying the trash you added, but, had you known the material, you wouldn't have dumped in the trash in the first place. I can document this at great length, but suffice it to read the relevant talk pages, and examine each time you've been reverted by a knowledgeable editor.Nishidani (talk) 202.71.190.26"
ok,""" Thanks for sharing that. Sorry if my tone earlier might have offended you. One of the first things I note, however, is that you were incorrectly assuming that the John W. Brown is a U.S. National Historic Landmark (NHL). It is not. It is one of about 85,000 historic sites or objects and historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien. Note, the ship is included in a Wikipedia NRHP list for its geographic area, but it is not included in the Wikipedia NHL list for Maryland. It is understandable that you would not know the distinction. But, looking for the John W. Brown in search screens for NHLs cannot lead to success. You did do well to find that Maryland Historical Trust webpage. I happen to know that is a summary by them of the full NRHP nomination document, from my having gone through detailed comparisons of other such webpages to actual NRHP documents which are available online for some Maryland sites (including the NHL ones), in consultation with editor Pubdog a while back. Pubdog developed most of the articles about NRHP-listed places in Maryland (indexed here). I asked Pubdog to comment here on this page, and perhaps that would have helped. The NHL URL that you reached, http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/REGIONS.htm, seems pretty good to me. It gives you phone numbers to call, and it gives you NHL_info@nps.gov as an email address to send any inquiries. I confirm that you found a bad link from that page; when I click on Questions/Answers there i too see that it links to http://www.nps.gov/nhl/QA which just gives an error message. However you do already have all the phone and email contact info you need to ask about any National Historic Landmark. I will email NHL_info@nps.gov to tell them that they have a bad link on that page, and I hope they will remove it to reduce anyone else's frustration. I hope this helps. I hope you do follow my advice in previous section to get the full NRHP document, since you do seem to genuinely care about developing this article on the SS John W. Brown, and since I believe that is a somewhat useful source for you to use. Good luck. ncram """

ok,""" I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth?s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ?brief flirtation? would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth)) But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth?s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found?which I suspect should not be difficult?that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle. """

It isn't...which reflects the ongoing, glaring weakness of Wikipedia in general: factual accuracy plays second fiddle to concerted efforts to rewrite history by collective entities. This 'Lebanon War' Wiki entry is a classic example of this. Israel clearly lost this campaign, but you can read the entire article and really not know who won. ...what a disservice Wikipedia is.

ok,"Thanks heah. This is helpful. Something to consider, is that the references you pointed to ? which are part of a larger list are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS; also, that subsequent research has not supported the same results. The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS, or more specifically to Kaposi?s sarcaoma, is that they are very weak in terms of data presented. The results have not been repeated by other scientists. In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers. The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi?s sarcaoma (KS)."

But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus.""""

In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact. What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with"""" (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""". I don't particularly like """"backlash"""" in lead, but at least in should be framed in the more NPOV """"many scholars and other observers have described it as a backlash . . . """" """

ok,WyrdLight Favonian - thanks for the steer about links etc. Clearly Wiki is the entity the community have made it and although the views and actions expressed don't seem consistent with many of the sentiments on the founders page such as objectivism etc that is the Wiki we have. There is no prospect other than repetition of this issue as new invigilators come and go. I can't see the merit of taking the stance expressed with an individual contributor such as myself. The website domain you may consider blacklisting is the one used by Wiki by association to validate copyright ownership of the materials I provide. The issue with all those images is that everyone of them contravenes a strict interpretation of the self-interest policy as the licence for use requires attribution including my domain. For this reason they must all be removed from wiki. Furthermore as the copyright holder I'm withdrawing permission for their use and display by Wiki and request their deletion. I'm assuming you have a bot or similar that can do so efficiently. These materials are a drop in the wiki ocean and will not have any impact on the community. Thank you.

Statistical information, such as date and place of birth, information on historical significance (N/A here), pictures, and information on accomplishments is usually accepted as the content of a biography on Wikipedia. What we have here are some of Keenan Davis' NFL stats. The page should be written from his childhood/early years up to how he got into the NFL and what he did to get there (such as being in minor leagues), like any normal biography.

If there are other reasons to delete it (there certainly may be), feel free to bring it up at AfD, but just having little content or no references isn't enough for CSD on its own.

He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote. To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are.

ok,""" Proposal Look all I am saying is that the term """"Iranian"""" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. Kurds have been mentioned for a very longtime by many different people, including the Sumerians! Nonetheless, I think there should be a change. I sort of agree with the Proposal above but I believe it can be better. Heres what I think should be written Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars. Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an """"Iranian ethnic group"""" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be """"Kurdish language(s)."""" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other. Bawer1 Bawer"""

ok,""". That date of """"1957"""" is not a date of publication; it is more likely a date of composition (which the site tends to use more than dates of publicationsee below). The play was published first in 1958 in a literary magazine (Encore) and subsequently published by various publishers such as Methuen (in the UK) and Grove Press (in the US), in various revised editions. One needs to do more advanced research to make such distinctions among possible dates of composition and dates of publication accurately. Pinter's works have a very complex compositional and publishing history. Please see the """"Bio-bibliographical Note"""" hosted on the Nobel Prize site for related critical resources if one wants more accurate information than is currently in this Wikipedia entry. The entry still needs substantial revision and editing. Cleanup [I'm adding a cleanup tag on the article.] Dates on Pinter's website often tend to be dates of final composition and/or dates of first performance and not dates of first publication and/or dates of (film/tv) release. (Several sections of his website were compiled by research assistants tasked with such work and by his (multiple) assistants beginning in around 2000, when the website was launched. There are sometimes typographical and other errors in the sections.) Some works were published long after they were first written; e.g. his novel The Dwarfs. When not confusing, one tries to use those dates or clarifies discrepancies otherwise. Did some cleanup of this article. Added some citations and additional sources for verification and further reading. """

HJ Mitchel was, in my honest opinion, a cunt to do what he did (people can make up their own mind exactly what that was), I'm not saying he is a cunt of a person but as a WP editor/contributor/admin, possibly through no fault of his own but by the fault of the rules, policies and guidelines that he follows. I don't want people berating me for what I've just typed, or congratulating me, I've spent enough time on WP to know that people will be willing to do both (admittedly moreso in a more public forum) and even more will simply think their opinions the response to this rant will be so WP-standard I shan't even bother checking. talk to me """

The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS, but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text. This is to find any remaining instances of hiddenStructure in templates.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater.

ok,""" Definitely his views contradict the current principles of Wikipedia. I don't think his intention is to comply with them. If no one expresses dissatisfaction and advocates change, there would be no improvement. On the other hand there are users who are abusing the system covertly, like user Zoe and user Mikkalai. User Zoe is using Wikipedia to torture people by artificially finding fault in people's contributions. If she is not sufering from Sadistic Personality Disorder, why doesn't she make contributions herself? What's there in it for her? User Mikkalai's point of view is not neutral. User Mikkalai from Belarussia (an area notorious for right wing tendencies) who is behind the current edition of the Intelligentsia article seems to have a political has reconstructionist, zarist, and nationalistic bias and his edits distort the truth through omission, taking things out of context, and other tools of propoganda. For some reason he stops on pre-revolution Russia, as if there was no further developments after that? Is that neutral? The important role intelligentsia played during the Soviet epoch (70 years of history) is understated if not absent from the article. There is no explanation of the role Jewish intelligents played in the revolution, and why many Jewish intelligents joined the revolution (pogroms and cherta osedlosti) is not mentioned. He is quoting Lenin as calling Intelligents """"the shit of the nation"""", while he does not mention that Lenin and Trotsky were intelligents themselves. The attribute of a cosmopolitan is not mentioned either, obviously because it is associated with Jews. He listed for deletion about Abram Kamensky, under the pretext of not being notable enough to be in Wikipedia. Abram Kamensky was mentioned in Russian Jewish Encyclopedia, which is a printed encyclopedia compiled by international experts. How is it that this person is not notable enough to be mentioned in an online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone? This person was mentioned in a Solzhenitsin's novel, he was a deputy minister of the ministry of national affairs, one of the first people to join the bolshevik party, as mentioned in the debate involved in the founding of the short-lived Donetsko-Krivorogian Soviet Republic, father of a well-known russian art critic. This is enough to make him notable. The reason he was demoted to a lower post was because he was briefly a member of the Trostkyst opposition, which Stalin didn't forgive him for. At any rate, the argument that he was somewhat obscure by the time of his death does not hold water, because many people who were famous died in obscurity. The point is, user Mikkalai from Belorussia does not possess a thorough enough knowledge of Soviet history to make that judgement. The reason he listed the article for deletion was personal and political bias. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was so people could add research and facts to someone's start-up. Not to list every start-up that is perhaps not well researched enough for deletion. User Mikkalai even listed Aleksander Kamensky article for deletion for reason of non-notability one of the most well known art crtitics in later twentieth century Russia, and an internationally recognized expert on Marc Chagall, whose book Marc Chagall, The Russian Years was an international best-seller, and was postthamously reprinted and presented at the Tretiakov gallery with Marc Chagall's granddaughters in attendance. What do you think, this guy knows what he is talking about? He has vandalized Aleksander Kamensky article. He took out Kamensky's definition of the stern style that was one of the three quotes from one of his books, translated personally by LevKamensky for the article. While in the articles discussion page he requested stern style to be defined. This shows that he deleted it without even reading it. If that is not vandalism, than what is? This is a wolf in sheeps clothing. I suggest reverting the article to LevKamensky's last edition and blocking it from further editing. Wikipidia articles are always on the first page when you make a search on Google, or another search engine. This makes Wikipidia a very influential tool in swaying public opinion. Many people complain that Americans are dumb, and they don?t know basic facts, or that they are shallow. Well now with the internet, they are becoming more aware, but don?t leave them in the hands of half-illiterate graduate students, or right wing fanatics. Why was the Russian Intelligentsia category deleted, that LevKamensky created, that contained some three dozen brightest minds in Russian culture of the XX century? Why does the Russian social groups category contain cosacs and peasants but not intellectuals? We think this is more political than neutral. So stop using Wikipedia"

I bet others would have suggestions/requests, too, if you let others know you might do some updating. Your tools have been tremendously useful to me and to others. About previous stuff, what I understand mostly is that you have not liked me or others generating minimal stub articles, unless a certain threshold of development or need is met, a threshold that you set differently than i have. I don't want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i've been working on recently are good or bad. These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings. I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front. I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks. I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links. It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings. Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial. You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.

In April, we met with Wikipedians to learn what they would like to know about other editors? history and activities (within Wikipedia) when interacting with them on talk pages. The goal was to gather feedback to help design a tool that could quickly communicate useful information about other Wikipedians. We have now created a few images that we feel represent some of what our participants thought was important. We would appreciate it if you took a few minutes of your time to complete an online survey that investigates whether or not these images would be useful to you. Your quick contribution would be very valuable to our research group and ultimately to Wikipedia. (When finished, the code for this application will be given over to the Wikipedia community to use and/or adjust as they see fit.) We are particularly interested in feedback from new editors! We want to make sure this tool meets your needs. Willing to spend a few minutes taking our survey? Click this link. Please feel free to share the link with other Wikipedians. The more feedback, the better! The survey is completely anonymous and takes less than 10 minutes to complete. All data is used for university research purposes only. Thank you for your time!

ok,"Civil Constitution of the Clergy The Roman Catholic Church was the dominating religion until the Revolution of 1789, when the revolutionaries sought to overthrow not only the monarchy and its supporters, but also the whole social and political system, including the Church. Although the Church survived the revolution, according to the ideology of the new republic it could no longer remain a separate estate with its own possessions. Therefore, the new government confiscated the land and assets belonging to the Church and auctioned them off to help resolve the financial problems that had led to the revolution. The state also attempted a huge restructuring of the Church hierarchy and demanded that the clergy swear allegiance to the French government ahead of the Church. Only a small percentage of priests complied with this request, but nevertheless this attempt to bring the Catholic Church under state control can be seen as the beginning of the development of secularism in France. As a description of the events of 1790, this lacks both neutrality and accuracy. The National Assembly did not conduct an entire revolution of the structure of society; they confiscated Church land to pay the national debt. (If they had, what would have been left for the Jacobins of 1793 to do?)"

If there is notation how to express something then it is quite simple to output vCard, hCard or html table etc. Contact information should be reusable from many different wiki page. I mean that if there's article about HP computer and other about HP printers contact to HP should be single HP contact object. Unfortunately I don't have glue how code extensions to wiki. I also don't know how much there is contact information in wikipedia, most likely only some. If there would be notation for addresses, phone number etc would anyone use it. Impossible to say. There is also other side of coin. It might be that implementation of contact information notation is just what everybody needed but did not realize needing it.

ok,"Howie Payne Hi Keith D I would like to protest the changes made by user 92.8.22.187 and subsequent locking of the page by yourself thus protecting his recent subbmissions I have reverted the changes revisions made by this user several times due to lack of references and dubious POV submissions. The user was contacted and referred via previous talk message pages to point out & explain this but despite this continued to revise the page without providing references for the changes submitted. As you have now locked the page with these incorrect/unreferenced submissions in place I would implore you to re evaluate the submissions made by user 92.8.22.187 and act accordingly. I will go into detail here in the hope it may help resolve some the issues with the edits submitted by user 92.8.22.187: I see no reason to now have 4 references to support the spelling of a name that has not been contested. - One of which is a pay site and another that contains a personal address! User 92.8.22.187 claims I have been changing the spelling of the name here despite his/her addition of references. A quick look will show I have been removing the references for matters outlined above but have not in any way changed the spelling of the name here. The reference to Payne's involvement in The Stands (5) has been changed from a full length interview with Payne about The Stands in a national publication (Designer Magazine) to review of a solo concert written 3 years after Payne's discontinuation of the group for a local fanzine that briefly introduces Payne as a former member of The Stands before reviewing a solo performance. Payne emigrating to US at age 13 - no reference Edgar Jones's commitment to Paul Weller being the reason for the break up of The Big Kids - No reference - Also Jones was no longer playing with Paul Weller at the time of The Big Kids break up (Winter 2001) The information regarding Pilgrim and Thomson's departure and the subsequent demise of the group as a result of this is wholly misleading - Pilgrim left The Stands in December - 2004 and was replaced by Graham Robinson in January 2005. The Stands then releaesed the single Do It Like You Like which entered the UK to 40 at no 26 and was used on the worldwide Revelon London Look campagihn featuring Kate Moss. The Stands then toured with Oasis during both their Europian tour. Luke Thompson left The Stands in June 2005 http://www.gigwise.com/news/6615/Luke-Thomson-Leaves-The-Stands and was replaced by Paul Molloy. The Stands released Horse Fabulous in July 2005 played Glastonbury - V Festival - T in the Park - an Oasis UK stadium tour - and a headline tour before Howie Payne released a statement to say he was discontinuing The Stands in Nov 2005. All of this plus the fact that the bands label, Echo records was dissolved by Chrysalis during August 2005 is available on The Stands dedicated wiki page. To sum this up as user 92.8.22.187 has done is totally miss-leading and not based in fact. Regarding Payne's solo career the new piece mentions Payne spending time in Texas and Los Angeles with neither relevance or reference. There is a further edit regarding Payne's name spelling and the submission implies there is a miss-spelling or changed spelling. As the only documents that are can decicivly prove the spelling of a persons birth name are Birth Certificate and Passport and none are provided here I will reserve judgement on this but I do think describing the spelling of Elliot (as here) as standard is ridiculous. There are at least popular spellings of the ame Elliott/Elliot/Eliot/Eliott/Elyott and it would seem the most popular is Elliott. I do not wish to appear to be pedantic regarding this but as this is typical of the caviler way user 92.8.22.187 has applied vague guesswork and then claimed them facts to the page in question and has accused me of changing his/her referenced submissions which is clearly not the case I hope that as a long standing contributor to wikipeidia you can see that my aim is to prevent this page being a false interpretations of events littered with unnecessary unreferenced/POV information. The previous page edition 01:30, 25 November 2012 has correct referenced information and I believe is a suitable and proper representation of events as per the information available at this point.

ok,"There I do not agree with you. Why? because the term white has often, very often been used in conjuction with ancestry and genetics concepts by people like Nordicists, Nazis later, and then important sectors of societies in many countries, that although not Nazis themselves, were fundamentally influenced by these ideologies in the 19th and 20th centuries. Therefore it would be tendentious to ignore genetics now that DNA analysis is available and is turnign on those theories. On the ohter hand, the term white has been used in anthropology. It is sad that we devote so much to the concept just as it was proposed by said ideologies. That is why I admit that I am often suspicious of people here, because I cannot understand that they want to devote so much to the part of the concept developed by Nazis and think it is normal. It is as if we would elaborate on concepts here according to the world view of the Talibans."

ok,""" First, I think it was SatuSuro who made the version about the Faith that is now on the page, and would like to thank him for his research and work. Both of the quotes I have added are verifiable, I can post the references again if necessary; they are not original research; they are also impartial in presenting the Faith's teachings because they do not attempt to sway a person one way or another about what to believe about them but rather present them directly because they ARE the teaching. Anyone elses summary of them could only be inaccurate. There are no major disputes as far as I am aware about the Baha'i teachings about the life of the soul after death. This summary of the Wikipedia article about a neutral point of view I believe is exactly what applies here: When we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that """"The Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: """"Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""", and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made. Likewise, the statement """"Most people from Liverpool believe that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"""" can be made if it can be supported by references to a particular survey; a claim such as """"The Beatles had many songs that made the UK Singles Chart"""" can also be made, because it is verifiable as fact. The first statement asserts a personal opinion; the second asserts the fact that an opinion exists and attributes it to reliable sources. Also, the Baha'i Faith has been consistently among the top three fastest growing religions in the world for about the last fifty years. There is sufficient public interest in it for it to be given due consideration on the basis of some other factor, and size and general public knowledge about the Faith are the only two factors remaining that I am aware of. As the Faith is growing faster than public knowledge can keep up with it it should not be considered solely from the point of view of the academic community, so the only impartial test for how much consideration it should be given compared to other religions would be its size, which is estimated at seven to ten million followers worldwide based on the most recent statistics and statements from the Baha'i World Center. Judaism has approximately fourteen million followers world-wide."""

The movies it lists are extremely inconsistent, and this page changes all the time.

I also think that we should delete links to reviews for films and music. What other refutable encyclopedia does this? You cannot systematically grade personal taste. ?Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.159.181.59 The point of the page is to list those films that have been previously recognized by a variety of critics and organization. The opinions of these films are not of Wikipedia users, but of a variety of organizations. Regardless of the notoriety of the sources, they don't constitute an article. The citations are to sources of opinion which should, in my opinion, be added to the articles of their respective films. 'Talktome I believe that the page should be deleted, Its very opinionated (yes i know its all sourced from other people) but still who has the deciding line on what the greatest film, there are many variants. This sort of page is suited to someones' blog, not a Wikipedia article. Its a fine line to what should be on Wikipedia but this i think should be deleted. Although this page somewhat irks me, I believe it would most likely make it through a deletion proposal with a Keep decision. The article is technically 100% factual in that it is stating, """"so and so thinks this movie is the greatest."""" Personally, I think that this sort of information on critic and audience opinions should be reserved for the individual entries for the films, and that an attempt to build a list such as this is inherently flawed. Specifically, my problem is that the personal opinions of Wikipedians are bound to show up in this article in that, in many cases, I believe that with enough searching you could find somebody's'' list that has your favorite movie on top. Of course, the failsafe against this is that editors must decide whether or not that """"somebody"""" is a notable c"

ok,""" Making progress Adding the links to the PLDD is itself not harmful. Then again, it's not as useful as it could be if you just add a link to the page and leave it at that. First thing you can do is to make people aware of the resource so that they can use it to write articles. WikiProjects are a good place to leave a note. Relevant ones include Wikipedia:WikiProject Middle Ages, Wikipedia:WikiProject Saints, Wikipedia:WikiProject Catholicism and Wikipedia:WikiProject Anglicanism. Most will have a resources page somewhere listing useful books and links, so mentioning PLDD in those would be helpful. If you have a look at the history tabs of the articles on relevant subjects, you can find editors who write about these things and may find them useful. Please don't go mad. A few messages will do: look at who started or expanded the articles rather than people who did spelling corrections or the like. If you do add PLDD links to a page, and you can see that there's some resistance to that idea, you should probably do a few other things at the same time. Make sure the article has a section on the relevant writings (a bibliography of sorts). Link to the Patrologia Latina article and then you can work in a mention of the PLDD version. If you add a bibliography and the article has footnotes using , include a footnote and use the or templates rather than just adding a mention in """"External links"""". Jonas of Orl?ans is an example where there are mentions of the works in the PLDD, and where adding a footnote saying where to find De cultu imaginum or De Institutione regia would be useful. This would be more work for you, but it would help us and our readers more. I will change Jonas tomorrow to show what I mean and let you know when done. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Not even a single scholar has ever suggested that Arianem Vaejo is the same as """"Haraivo or the Greek """"Aria"""".

The Old Persian satapry Hari-Rud (which was not called Hari-Rud in Old Persian) is clearly mentioned in both Darius I's Behistun Inscription as well as two of Xerxes' inscriptions.

ok,"Reply Yo-Yo Ma You're using what I said every time I edited and just pinpointed this one sentence. I very well know that to be an American, you think like an American. That's it. However, you're getting way too technical. Beyond technical. Super technical. If some random person starts reading his article and sees that he's an American, he might just have the perception of him being American. Let me ask you what the hell is wrong with putting Chinese-American? It's stupid to like saying you are what you are now, you must forget your past. Outrageous."

It seems slightly more important he survived cancer."
